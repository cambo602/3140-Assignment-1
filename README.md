This game is a simple Towers of Hanoi implementation

The start state is 3 pillars, with one pillar containing all the discs stacked in growing order of size

You can than move the top disc of any pillar to another pillar as long as the top disc on the new pillar is bigger than the one you are attempting to place (or if no discs are on that pillar)

You win the game by putting every disc in order on one of the other 2 pillars

The game tracks move of the disc as a move to use as a score

The player can reset the game with the reset button if they are stuck/ want to start over
